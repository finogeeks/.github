## About the Company
Founded in 2017, **FinoGeeks is a technology company focusing on providing unique product solutions to enable clients to build their own digital ecosystems.** 
 
Stemming with a technical root in the financial sector where financial institutions require strongly secured, compliant and especially robust technologies to connect with partners and consumers online, the company initially aimed at delivering foundation technologies to facilitate digital connectivity. Having built a carrier-grade digital connectivity platform on the cloud of Shenzhen Stock Exchange to help the stock brokerage industry reaching out to consumers at external partners channels, the company has since leveraged the strong network effect to expand into major business sectors of auto, e-commerce, consumer finance, IoT, government and beyond.
 
FinoGeeks has a vision that **any company to survive and thrive in the digital age needs to build its own digital ecosystem to connect partners and reach consumers.** To play this platform game well, an enterprise operates its very own ‚Äòapp store‚Äô hosting vast number of digital scenarios as digital contents supplied by partners. FinoGeeks seeks to be the provider of such a toolset to help companies build such a technology platform in their own full possessions.
 
FinoGeeks‚Äô technology brings two key values to the market. Firstly, it helps developers to transform their business scenarios into live digital programs using truly standard, open Internet technologies, with agility and low-cost but without vendor lock-in. Secondly it enables platform players to source rich digital application offerings from large number of developers/suppliers because now there is a gigantic resource pool to tap into.
 
Headquartered in Shenzhen China, FinoGeeks employs an elite team of 95 members comprising mostly engineers scattering over multiple cities. The company pursues a single-product strategy and has devoted major financial investment and engineering efforts toward R&D of FinClip, an innovative product in its own class.
 
FinoGeeks is a member of the W3C and a participant of the W3C Mini-Apps workgroup. FinoGeeks has led or helped drive technology standardization efforts in such areas as 5G Message Mini-App Data Security Standard in the Telecom industry and Instant Messaging Data Protocol Standard in the Securities industry.
 
FinoGeeks has filed 30+ patents and won various awards.
